# QA'QC code for GL4 buoy sensors 
The buoy is deploed in GL4 as a part of Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Program (https://nwt.lternet.edu/data)

The buoy is instramented with 8 invidual RBR sensors that measure temperature, 3 PME sensors that measure dissloved oxygen, 1 PME sensor that uses a Li-COR quantum sensor to measure photosynthetically active radiation, and 1 PME C7 sensor to opically measure chlorophyll concentration. 

# Explaination of scripts:
  All original scripts from 2018 are labeled with "_Summer18"
  
  All current scripts in which ongoing sensor QA'QC can take place are labeled with "_agg"
